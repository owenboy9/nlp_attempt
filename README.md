a simple hybrid of a dadaist poet and a pythia, an app deeply rooted in european romantic tradition, in other words. it asks the user to choose how many words from the parts of speech that are on offer they want to use, and then it fishes those words at random from gertrude stein's tender buttons and virginia woolf's mrs. dalloway. then it spits out a prophetic verse.

***more to come***

in the future, the app will:
1. arrange the words in a controlled order, interlacing the different parts of speech instead of jamming them together
2. offer the option of ordering a poem on a theme of one's choice
3. offer the option of choosing if the output should have a 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment
3. offer a more elaborate graphic interface
4. be available online, be in on a localhost server, but still

***in fact***

it's not true.

it will work like a piano: you press parts of speech in the order you want to have them, and it'll compose your poem of words corresponding to them, in the order you asked for.

the general sentiment will still be an option.
