a simple hybrid of a dadaist poet and a pytia, an app deeply rooted in european romantic tradition, in other words. it asks the user to choose how many words from the parts of speech that are on offer they want to use, and then it fishes those words at random from gertrude stein's tender buttons. then it spits out a prophetic verse.

***more to come***

in the future, the app will:
1. arrange the words in a controlled order, interlacing the different parts of speech instead of jamming them together
2. offer the option of ordering a poem on a theme of one's choice
3. offer a more elaborate graphic interface
4. be available online, be in on a localhost server, but still
