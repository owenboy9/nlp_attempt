a simple hybrid of a dadaist poet and a pythia. it works like a piano: 

you press parts of speech that are on offer, and it composes your poem by picking words at random (or is it by fate?) from within their categories. and then it spits out a prophetic verse.

its vocabulary sprouts out of gertrude stein's tender buttons and virginia woolf's mrs. dalloway. for now, that is: the literary universe is vast and malleable.

also! it writes its poems into text files (based on their mood temperature). can there be a smoother way of producing a poetry volume?!

***more to come***

in the future, the spythia will:
1. offer the option of ordering a poem on a theme of one's choice
2. offer the option of choosing if the output should have a 'positive,' 'negative' or 'neutral' sentiment
3. offer a more elaborate graphic interface
4. be available online, be it in on a localhost server, but still


***in fact***

it's not entirely true.

the general sentiment will most likely be a category for spythia to sort and save their prophetry in files. something like:

VERY SAD POEMS

SOMEWHAT GLOOMY VERSES

INDIFFERENT LINES, IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE

LITTLE DIMPLE LYRICS

...
and so on. for now, it's really hard to imagine spythia manufacturing chirpingly cheerful candy bites â€“ but who knows?
